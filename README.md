# LiveHike
LiveHike is a native iOS application that addresses the lack of real-time information available to hikers. While existing apps provide general trail information, LiveHike delivers community-driven, up-to-the-minute hazard updates, wildlife identification, and navigation assistance.

## Features
1. Wildlife Recognition - Identify plants and animals with our AI-powered scanner to check for potential dangers
2. Hazard Reporting System - Report and view physical trail hazards with images, locations, and descriptions
3. Wrong Turn Pins - Access community-created navigation assistance at confusing trail intersections
4. Trail Safety Ratings - View historical hazard data and risk assessments before heading out

## Usage
1. Find a Trail - Search for trails and check real-time hazard reports before hiking
2. Report Hazards - Take photos of hazards you encounter and mark their location for other hikers
3. Identify Wildlife - Use the scanner to identify potentially dangerous plants and animals
4. Create Navigation Pins - Help other hikers by marking tricky trail intersections

## Technology
